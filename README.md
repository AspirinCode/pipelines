# Piplelines.
The project experiments with ways to generate data processing piplelines.
Currently it has some python scripts using RDKit (http://rdkit.org) that can be executed individually, or piped together.

Also, these can be executed in Docker containers (separately or as a sinlge unit.

Additionally they can be executed using Nextflow (http://nextflow.io)

Note: this is highly experimental, everything is subject to change, and there are no guarantees that anything works!
That said, if you are interested let me know, and join the fun.
